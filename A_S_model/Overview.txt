I: Units 

All distances are in units of nanometers 





II: How to use 
	




III: Different folders and their purpose 

	i) A_S_model: that main folder that contains the rest of the program 

       ii) Generators; the folder that contains all code that is used to generate files that are use in other parts of the code. Mainly that is where you will find the code that takes in an image and produces the map that the software will then use to for the basis of the simulation. 
	
      iii) Model: The Main body of the code where you will find the main code itself as well as the files for the defined functions that are used in the main body of the code. 

       iv) Reference: The folder that contains the images that are fed in to produce the maps as well as the maps themselves. Any further extension
